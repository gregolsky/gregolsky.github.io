## about

I'm a software developer with a few years of experience in server-side, as well as client-side web-development. I built up my experience mostly on Microsoft technologies (ASP.NET MVC, SQL Server), however I am eager to learn new things and experiment, not limiting myself to one specific approach or tech.

Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science Nicolaus Copernicus University graduate. Advanced GIT user. HTML5 and JavaScript enthusiast. Open source aficionado. Currently focused on frontends building and Node.js scripting.

Privately a techno geek, sci-fi addict, a music lover and a father of two.
