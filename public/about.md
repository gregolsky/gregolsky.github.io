## about me

I'm a software developer with a few years of experience in server-side, as well as client-side web-development. I built up my experience mostly on Microsoft technologies (ASP.NET MVC, SQL Server), however I am eager to learn new things and experiment, not limiting myself to one specific approach or tech.

Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science Nicolaus Copernicus University graduate. Advanced GIT user. HTML5 and JavaScript enthusiast. Open source aficionado. Currently focused on frontends building and Node.js scripting.

Privately a techno geek, sci-fi addict, a music lover and a father of two to-be.

## about this place

We all learn stuff and have ways to remember and better understand the things we get to know. For me it's always been practice and trying things out in the field, but as we know human memory is not the best container to store *all* of the information on the certain subject and after all we only remember that there was a *thing*.

To solve this problem I am going to write about my solutions to issues I encounter, my pet projects, new stuff in tech I am excited with and from time to time I may spill a few words about my impressions on non-tech subjects I'm interested with.
